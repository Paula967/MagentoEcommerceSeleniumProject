Magento E-Commerce Selenium Automation Project
📚 Overview
This project is a Selenium Automation Framework designed to test key functionalities of the Magento E-Commerce platform. It leverages modern testing methodologies, robust design patterns, and advanced reporting tools to ensure the application operates seamlessly and meets business requirements.

🎯 Objectives
The primary goal of this project is to:

Automate end-to-end workflows of the Magento platform.
Ensure high test coverage, maintainability, and scalability of the automation framework.
Generate comprehensive reports for better analysis and debugging.
🛠️ Technologies and Tools
1. Programming Language
Java: Used for writing test scripts due to its reliability and compatibility with Selenium.
2. Testing Framework
TestNG: Used for test case management, annotations, assertions, and generating structured test reports.
3. Build Tool
Maven: Used for dependency management and project build execution.
4. Automation Tool
Selenium WebDriver: Used for browser automation to interact with the application under test.
5. Version Control
Git: Used for tracking changes and collaborating effectively.
6. Reporting Tool
Allure Reports: Provides visually appealing and detailed reports, including screenshots for failed test cases.
7. Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
IntelliJ IDEA: Used for writing and managing the test scripts.
🧑‍💻 Key Design Patterns
1. Page Object Model (POM)
Segregates test logic and UI interactions into different classes.
Improves readability, reusability, and maintainability of test scripts.
2. Fluent Design Pattern
Chains method calls for better readability and ease of use.
Ensures cleaner test scripts by reducing redundancy.
📝 Test Scenarios
Automated Workflows:
User Registration: Automates the account creation process.
Login and Logout: Verifies user authentication and session management.
Search Functionality: Tests product search with various filters.
Add to Cart: Ensures products are added to the cart correctly.
Checkout Process: Automates payment flow and order placement.
Order Confirmation: Verifies that orders are successfully placed.
